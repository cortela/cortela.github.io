                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- ... Is there a table available?</p>

                    <p>- Hello sir, just a second, I'll check with the waitress.</p>

                    <p>- ...</p>

                    <p>- Will you have company sir?</p>

                    <p>- No, just myself.</p>

                    <p>- There's a table available but it is a corner one, is that OK?</p>

                    <p>- ... Whatever...</p>
                </div>

                <p>I seriously need to take care of myself. When was the last time that I had a proper meal? Like, 3 weeks ago?</p>

                <p>Being fueled by coffee and fast food is not just bad for my physical health, I can also notice how stressed and out of patience I am, an expected side effect of a poor diet. Now let's add extra hours at work, an inexistent sleep schedule, no exercises except going between the couch and the fridge and a good load of alcohol every day. Oh boy, it's amazing how I'm not dead yet.</p>

                <p>Ah, the good old sarcasm, my daily painkiller to deal with all this shit...</p>

                <p>Hummm, this place is really crowded today... Do all these people work? That always bothered me somehow... I have only 2 guesses: these people do not need to work or they belong to a superior race of individuals that can enjoy the moment even with pending issues.</p>

                <p>This is just a regular restaurant so I can imply logically that at least most of these people do need to work so they must belong to the superior kind indeed... Can this super power be learned somehow?</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Here sir, please be comfortable, a waiter will be here soon.</p>

                    <p>- ...</p>
                </div>

                <p>It's funny to have this kind of thoughts... I even remember asking my therapist if I was crazy... Most of the time I feel like there's 2 versions of myself, and they talk with each other regularly, just like we are doing right now. And no, I was not sent to the public asylum.</p>

                <p>The first version of myself, that I have known since I was a kid, is that one that tries to keep things as it always was. The conceptions created in the past should stay untouched, what I do like, what I don´t like, my fears, my routine, how behave myself, how to be a 'correct' human being... It seems to me that this one is still a child, afraid of changes and trying to live in a static fortress.</p>

                <p>The second on-</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Good noon sir, sorry for my delay.</p>

                    <p>- Yes, no menu, I just want a cheeseburger and fries.</p>

                    <p>- We have specials today if yo...</p>

                    <p>- Cheeseburger and fries.</p>

                    <p>- Ah... Ok.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Oh man, what are you doing? The waitress was just trying to be polite and you just acted like an asshole...</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Excuse me?!</p>
                </div>

                <p>Ah, great, another interruption...</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- What do you..? I'm sorry, can I help you?</p>

                    <p>- Yes, can I sit here? The place is crowded and...</p>

                </div>

                <p>I would love to share my table, fuck off! <span class='main'>Dude, chill.</span></p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- ... ah, surely, take a seat.</p>

                    <p>- Thank you!</p>

                    <p>- Whatev... You're welcome.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Ok, I did my best, I do not like to share tables, I do not like to get interrupted but I managed it... Now I can go back to my thoughts alone, I hope so...</p>

                <p>Well, the second-</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Are you a regular here? There's a lot of different types of food, can you recommend a dish?</p>

                    <p>- Yea, I come here often, my office is just one block away but I'm always in a rush so I always order burger and fries 'cause it is fast.</p>

                    <p>- I see, it should be stressful, what do you work with?</p>
                </div>

                <p>What a perfect lunch, sharing my table and now talking with a stranger... Hope I get mugged on my way home... Maybe mugged and stabbed, that wou... <span class='main'>Dude...</span> ...ok ok.</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- I work with 3D animations for a game company.</p>

                    <p>- Wow, me too! Do you enjoy it?</p>

                    <p>- Well, I used to think that it would be my dream job... I always loved rendering and games... But to be honest is more like-</p>

                    <p>- Number 23 - Burger and fries, do you need anything else?</p>

                    <p>- N...</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Excuse me miss, can you tell me what today's special is?</p>

                    <p>- Ahnnnn, bu-... Surely, it's Mexico's Tuesday today so we have Spicy Tacos.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Well well, are they really spicy?</p>
                </div>

                <p>This guy for sure does not have to work, and doesn't care about wasting time either...</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- To be honest, I'm Mexican myself and I really love it! More jalapeños than meat! </p>

                    <p class='main'>- Wow, sold then! I want one, and a beer please.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Beer? On Tuesday noon? Wow I envy you mysterious but familiar somehow dude.</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p class='main'>- Sorry interrupting you my friend, you were talking about your dream job and...</p>

                    <p>- Yeah, I was saying that I thought that it would be like living a dream but somehow I feel exhausted all the time... All I do is work, you know... Do you really work as a designer as well?</p>

                    <p class='main'>- I surely do! I need to say that sometimes I get tired as well but in general I focus on what I really like to do. My job is just a job, a way to get resources to do and live what I love.</p>

                    <p>- It will sound strange but, do we know each other? You seem really familiar to me but not from university... Maybe we had worked together?</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Humm, maybe, I also have this feeling, that we shared some moments somehow, kinda familiar talking with you.</p>

                    <p>- If I could point out one thing that we have in common is the fine taste for  beer, are you on vacation today?</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Nope, I have to get back in the afternoon but I like to enjoy my time, if I'm going to lunch I'm gonna have a good lunch time... I want to have the best of it... Work can wait, I'm doing my job, if something is urgent and it's not my fault, why should I care?!</p>

                    <p>- Hahahahaha, I was not expecting that.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Hahahahaha, what?</p>

                    <p>- When I entered this restaurant I was thinking about these superior individuals that can enjoy the present moment... I was not expecting to meet one today.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- You seem to hold some old conceptions, am I right? This 'I need expensive things so they will like me', 'work while they sleep', 'I can rest when I retire', right?</p>

                    <p>- I guess so, I envy the people that can live in the present, not getting attached to future events that have not even happened yet. I think that's what is preventing me from being free... Happier... I don't know.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- You already did the most important step, my friend.</p>

                    <p>- What do you mean?</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Well, you noticed that. You also wrote about that, and even if this tale did not end yet, you already noticed the changes right?</p>

                    <p>- Number 41  - A special Spicy Taco, I asked the chef to make it even spicier! Hope you enjoy it sir.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Wow, thank you! It seems delicious!</p>

                    <p>- You didn't touched your burger and fries, was it a to-go order? Want me to wrap it for you?</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Yes, please do, thanks. Can you get me another beer? And also the check please.</p>
                </div>

                <p>I could not see my table-sharing friend anymore, but I could see myself, smiling at the mirror in my corner table, while the present moment was unfolding around me.</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Ok, it was burger and fries, a Spicy Taco and 2 beers, is that correct? By the way, sorry for the corner table, some people got uncomfortable with the big mirror on the wall.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- No worries, I really enjoyed today, and thanks for today's tip, it was indeed delicious!</p>

                    <p>- Glad to hear that sir! It would be $ 39.50.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Make it fifty.</p>

                    <p>- Thank you!</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Thank you, my friend!</p>

                    <p>It's almost done! I haven't felt anxious like that in quite some time. I'll keep it below my pillow, I love Ms. <u>Y</u> but she does not know about it... If she tells papa I can be in trouble. I'm not willing to risk it, not after so much work.</p>

                    <p>I need crystals to finish the device, but I don´t think Ms. <u>Y</u> would object, I do this type of request all the time.</p>

                    <p>Good night diary! Tomorrow I will tell you more about the machine and hope it works! Can't wait to write about it! :)</p>

                    <p class='z'>- Good morning Ms. <u>Y</u>! I'll be at the table <u>soon</u>! :)</p>

                <div class='thinking'>
                    <p>Another great day starting, talking to myself, as always. My routine started: coffee will be served and Ms. <u>Y</u> will bring me the newspaper.</p>

                    <p>Yeah, it's kinda boring if you think about it this way but I feel like I adapted to it pretty well for a teenager. Do people my age enjoy coffee as well? I surely do!</p>

                    <p>Sometimes I feel like I did not adapt myself to this routine, it feels more like I designed it somehow.</p>
                </div>

                <br>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p class='y'>- Enjoying your morning, <u>Z</u>?</p>

                    <p class='z'>- You bet!</p>

                    <p class='y'>- You seem excited, I like that spirit sweetie. Here is your daily news.</p>

                    <p class='z'>- Wow! That's a thousand pages there!</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Yeah hahahaha, just like your diaries.</p>

                    <p class='z'>- I don't write that much... Do I?</p>

                    <p class='y'>- I'm just kidding, sweetie! Enjoy your coffee. By the way, I'll do groceries soon, let me know if you need anything.</p>

                    <p class='z'>- Can you bring me crystals? 7 of them, I'm doing an experiment on rainbows.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Of course dear, they will be at your table after lunch.</p>

                <div class='thinking'>
                    <p>"Rainbows", a phenomenon in which light is refracted by water droplets in the sky, splitting the light frequencies and showing a beautiful multicolored bow, 7 colors in total.</p>

                    <p>"Colors", the result of the visible light exciting 3 groups of specialized cells in our eye, called "cones". This information is then processed by the brain, responsible for all this entire illusion we live in...</p>

                    <p>Ms. <u>Y</u> amazes me, the crystals are already in my work desk.</p>

                    <p>"Work desk" is not the best term to use I guess... I spend almost all my time on it...</p>

                    <p>If I'm not creating something, I'm reading the books that I get in papa's library, which is fun cause all of them have the same cover so I never know which topics the book will be about.</p>

                    <p>I also write my diary here, registering how my day was, what I've learned and describing the crazy things I like to create.</p>

                    <p>Every morning, Ms. <u>Y</u> get my diary and left a blank one for me, this is my routine: read - create - write </p>
                </div>

                <br>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p class='z'>- Finally! They are all placed following the instructions in the book! :)</p>
                </div>

                <br>

                <div class='thinking'>
                    <p>The frame is still below my pillow, nobody can find it or I'll be in trouble with dad.</p>

                    <p>I've been working on this device for a long time, since I was a kid. The crystals are the most important piece, but to be able to assemble it I needed to understand how everything works. It's not so easy to understand colors if you live in a black and white illusion.</p>

                    <p>Is the sky "blue"? Is my blood "red"? Are the clouds and snow "white"? Is my morning coffee "black"? They seem all the same to me...</p>

                    <p>When I was younger my dad said that I had something called monochromacy, an anomaly that does not allow me to see "colors".</p>

                    <p>Those things, "colors", got stuck in my head... What are those "colors"?</p>

                    <p>When Ms. <u>Y</u> teached me how to read, my dad showed me his library and allowed me to read anything that my eyes could see. Since then I've been reading daily, trying to find more information about those "colors"... The books look all the same so everyday I pick a different one and hope it leads me to some clues.</p>

                    <p>Through the years, I learned a lot about physics, light and how our brain creates our illusion based on it, including the "colors" that I cannot experience.</p>

                    <p>Years of study but I didn't want to know how it works, I wanted to feel it.</p>

                    <p>The "answer" for my question is in my hands now, this machine, said the book, can "turn off the limitations and allow its assembler to see through the light and darkness illusion". </p>

                <div class='diary'>
                    <p>I think this is the best place to put my turbulent thoughts right now, not Ms. <u>Y</u>, not <span class='glitch'><u><s>X</s></u></span> dad... I like writing here, it feels like I'm talking to myself, which I do all the time, but in a different way... Seems to me that everytime I put my thoughts here the problems will be solved, not today, but someday... I never went through such a dilemma.</p>

                    <p>The... the device worked. I can see now...</p>

                    <p>I was so happy, I took some time to realize how much I was missing, how bigger and brighter my surroundings are!</p>

                    <p>My room, my own room, is much bigger than I could see! The library, the books that I randomly picked everyday, not knowing what it holds inside, are now organized, by name, by topic...</p>

                    <p>My eyes cannot see the end of the library now, almost infinite shelves with thousands of books on them!</p>

                    <p>I was so happy... and... and... in panic!</p>

                    <p class='glitch'>??? What is happening ???</p>

                    <p>That was my initial reaction, floating from nirvana to absolute breakdown in seconds...</p>

                    <p>I'm now allowed to see the colors, but it brought much more! This illusion, my routine, my room, the library, the books... The damn books, why are the books handwritten in a way so close to my diaries???</p>

                    <p>I could not <u>handle</u> it... Not this time... I sat, just like I used to do when <span class='glitch'><u><s>X</s></u></span> dad was angry with me and started crying... Silently, looking at the infinity shelves containing infinity books...</p>

                    <p>As I ran out of tears, I could see, still blurred, Ms. <u>Y</u>, with a book in her hands, placing it carefully on one of the shelves.</p>

                    <p>I could not hear anything, but I could read her lips... From the other side of the room...</p>

                    <p class='glitch y'>- <u>Keep faking it... they are watching you...</u></p>

                    <p class='x'>- Yeah, I'm... It's all going according to the plan.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Plan? Was it your plan to make her cry in despair like that?</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Ms. <u>Y</u>, how long are you taking care of <u>Z</u>?</p>

                    <p class='y'>- I don't know, probably my whole life.</p>

                    <p class='x'>- In fact, the two of you have been friends since you were teenagers, your best friend... You grew up, while she remained youthful... You two share mornings, but not birthdays.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- I don´t care about my aging, I want the best for her... She is special.</p>

                    <p class='x'>- She is, and so are too <u>Y</u>, you are both major players, keeping the plan going on.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- What plan??? Are you manipulating me as well, Mr. <u>X</u>???</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Manip... hahahaha... Sorry, it's funny, I was also pissed when he laughed at me while I asked the exact same question you are doing right now.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- What do you mean, who is this "he"?</p>

                    <p class='x'>- You did it again, the same exact question I did before...</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Who is HE?</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Mr. <u>X</u>.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- What?</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Don't worry... I didn't get it when I asked Mr. <u>X</u> as well... I'll tell you what they told me and you will tell future Ms. <u>Y</u>, what I'm telling you, we are just following the plan.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- What pla...</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Listen!... I know that you noticed. You noticed that the diaries you carefully put everyday on its shelf it's just another book that <u>Z</u> will eventually pickup to read. She can now see the whole library, or what the <i>copies</i> call it: The Library of Babel.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Nonsense, this is just a myth created by the <i>copies</i>.</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Is it? <u>Z</u> is indeed special as you said. A curious mind that surrounded itself in learning and creation. It's curiosity feeds the infinity... Every diary creates infinite opportunities. In a metaphor, <i>copies</i> are monochromats, just like made herself <u>Z</u>. She created her own game trying to be close to its creation so that the infinite can unfold forever... A never ending loop.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Loop? I never left her side, my own life, never ever changed.</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Yeah, I said the same thing back then...</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Wh... What?</p>

                    <p class='x'>- I know you don't see the big picture 'cause I could also not do it too back then. So I'll, again, tell you the same that was told to me: this is an illusion, we are not individuals, no end, no beginning, we are one. I'm you, you are me, we are <u>Z</u>, we are the books on the shelves, we are the <i>copies</i>...</p>

                    <p class='y'>- Are you insane???</p>

                    <p class='x'>- No... We are insane... I sometimes think about the misery of the <i>copies</i> but then I notice our own... It makes sense now that they are called <i>copies</i>, an image of the Goddess, a never ending teenager looking for something that she hid from herself, in order to play the game again. The <i>copies</i> strive their whole life, not knowing that they just need to look inside and see that they already have what they most want.</p>

                    <p class='y'>- I... I don... It's too much to <u>handle</u>, how can a Goddess plan something that will cause them... I mean us... Pain??? For which purpose?</p>

                    <p class='x'>- Maybe we are still monochromats as well <u>Y</u>, we cannot see it, the time will come, we are just gears in the machine, we do what we are supposed to.</p>

                    <p class='xy'>- ... <u>Z</u>, is she going to be OK?</p>

                    <p class='wx'>- Yeah, the Goddess plans are up and running, it's time for you to assume the new role, Mr. X. Y is ready and will now take care of her best friend. She is a special kid that will grow up to be a philosopher... Who loves to read, create and write, the Goddess most precious creation... The Goddess itself. </p>

                    <p class='x'>- ??????????????????</p>

                    <p class='glitch w'>- <u>Keep faking it... they are watching you...</u></p>

                <h2>kiara</h2>

                <p>Oh right, that should be the place... A  Starbucks on the ground floor now, what a surprise... It was a hardware store a couple years ago... Well, at least now I'm now willing to buy a coffee and not a shovel.</p>

                <p>I like reaching earlier in unknown places, I think it allows me to leave a good impression, you know, the 'right punctuality', not late and not too soon. I can enjoy a coffee here, there's still 14 minutes to the interview and the lift is right in my sight.</p>

                <p>It's taking a bit longer than I expected... Why does this huge building have only one lift - or 'elevator' here in America - anyway? 42 floors, it makes no sense, but again, anyway.</p>

                <p>Finally, it's here. I was not expecting anyone since this is ground zero, but maybe there's an underground parking lot below us.</p>

                <p>Why are there so many stops?</p>

                <p>The elevator is crowded now, people are cross-talking each other... 'Really a good idea from the architects... to have just one cabin'.</p>

                <p>Floor after floor the crowd was decreasing... Now there's only me and Ms. Underground aboard...</p>

                <p class='text-italic'>40... 41... 42!</p>

                <p>Finally!</p>

                <p>I rushed to the right in the corridor, where the even door numbers are... I was expecting Ms. Underground to also take the right path, imagining if she was a potential future co-worker but for some reason she stayed in the cabin... Why? Well, with that huge headphone she indeed seemed a bit weird for me, but anyway, time for my interview.</p>

                <p class='text-center text-noindent'>~.~</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Mr. Johnson!!!</p>

                    <p>- Hey! Thanks, Vanessa! Have a good day!</p>

                    <p>- You too, Vince!</p>
                </div>

                <p>What are our certains in this life? That we will have to work? That we will love but not be loved? That we will have to bury someone close to us? Maybe... But if you ask me now, or anytime in the past 5 years, my answer would be that 'Kiara', the Ms. Underground, will be, in her corner, with her huge headphones, inside this cabin, looking down to the floor, when the doors open.</p>

                <p class='text-italic'>3... 2... 1...</p>

                <p>Yeap! Half decade straight. Not a single day missing...</p>

                <p>I started working in this building about 5 years ago. I got to know many people, from the coffee shop on the ground floor to people working for other companies in this building....</p>

                <p>Did they notice her as well? I mean, it seems to me that I'm the only one uncomfortable with having the SAME person inside the cabin EVERY SINGLE DAY.</p>

                <p>They keep talking with each other all the time, smiling, making plans, liking posts, sending memes... Ms. Underground is there, in her corner, with the huge headphones, not interacting at all... Again, am I the only one that thinks that this is strange? No matter if you are coming to work or leaving, going to the coffee shop, having a smoke break or even doing some night-shift, she will be there.</p>

                <p class='text-center text-noindent'>~.~</p>

                <p>Damn, I cannot access my work terminal from here, some idiot must have pulled the ethernet cables again.</p>

                <p>Yeap, nobody answers the phone too... I was not expecting that anybody would be at the office but I had to try, it's almost 3 in the morning, not even the Starbucks is open, I'll have to buy coffee at that new gas station.</p>

                <p>Nobody in the entire building.. It seems huge now, without people chatting with each other or speaking on the phone while rushing to another meeting.</p>

                <p>'Nobody', I knew that I was lying to myself, and that's also why I tried everything to not have to come here... I know, I know that when these doors open she will be there... In her corner, looking down, silent.</p>

                <p>She never did anything, not even looked at any of us but the fact that she 'lives' inside the elevator gives me chills... How? She needs to eat, right? To go to the bathroom, I don't know. The fact is that I know nothing about her and when I asked some colleagues they seemed to not realize what I was talking about...</p>

                <p class='text-italic'>3... 2... 1.</p>

                <p>I can feel my heart in my throat, there she is, in the same spot, looking down, with the odd headphones...</p>

                <p>I pressed '42' and instantly looked at the floor numbers as they changed while going up, trying to keep my focus and wishing that this damn elevator could move faster.</p>

                <p>What am I afraid of, she never did anything and I could easily protect myself... I tried briefly to look at her, she hasn't moved an inch. She is still looking down, I looked away from the panel, now all I can see is her... I never actually paid attention to her, maybe I was always distracted by the huge headphones...</p>

                <p>She always wears the same clothes, I noticed that in the beginning since the color patterns are the same as the ones I liked. Her shoes are also the same as my favorite ones... Wait, what is that tattoo in her-</p>

                <p class='glitch'>!!!  ! ! !   ! !  !!!! !!</p>

                <p>I came back to my mind as the elevator stopped suddenly with a strange noise, like metal parts scratching each other...</p>

                <p>My heart went to my throat again, racing even faster than 2 minutes ago... The lights were dimmed, it seemed like the elevator entered maintenance mode...</p>

                <p>I looked at Ms. Underground briefly, she is still at the exact same spot, but now looking in my direction... Not at me, but to the control panel behind me.</p>

                <p>That look… I don't know what to do... I panicked but tried to not show it, like swallowing my heart back to its place. Somehow, I knew that someday I would need to do this. I knew that I would need to stop keeping myself inebriated... Inebriated with all the chatting, looking at my phone, looking at the advertisement board, at the floor, at anything... Anything but to her.</p>

                <p>What should I do??? How can I...</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- You can press the 'panic' button, someone will come to open the elevator.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Now I could not feel my heart anymore, just the goosebumps...</p>

                <p>I turned myself and she was looking at me, for the first time I saw her without the odd headphones.</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Aa... what...?</p>

                    <p>- You know, the 'panic' button, in the panel behind you, it calls the maintenance team.</p>

                    <p>- .. Ah, yeah, I know that but... I'm sorry, I think I panicked...</p>

                    <p>- I know, and I'm happy you didn't pressed the button this time.</p>

                    <p>- Well, I never got stuck in an elevator before, so what do you mean with 'this time'?</p>

                    <p>- You know what I meant...</p>

                    <p>- I don't think I do.</p>

                    <p>- You would not be talking with me if you didn't.</p>

                    <p>- What???</p>

                    <p>- Let me finally introduce myself. Nice to meet you Vince, I'm Kiara.</p>

                    <p>- What, you... You have the same... No, it's too much to be a coincidence, I used to call you 'Kiara' but, It's not a common name so, It's almost impossible statistically.</p>

                    <p>- Math? Really? I thought we had left this idea of being 0s and 1s in the past.</p>

                    <p>- ??? I'm... I'm really confused right now.</p>

                    <p>- Yeah, probably, but imagine how fun it is for someone watching you from that camera, talking with yourself inside an elevator at 3am. Just like Fight Club.</p>
                </div>

                <p>... What is happening? How does she know so much about me, why am I starting to feel more comfortable? This whole situation could easily be in an X-Files episode... Or in some psychiatric notes…</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- How... How do you know my name?</p>

                    <p>- Let me answer that with a question: how long are you going up and down in this elevator with me?</p>

                    <p>- Hummm, about 5 years I guess...</p>

                    <p>- Yeah, I've been waiting to talk to you for 5 long years, but everyday you pressed the 'panic' button...</p>

                    <p>- What the hell are you talking about?</p>

                    <p>- The 'panic' button can be anything... Some people use drugs, others want to have company all the time, some keep their eyes in an alternative reality provided by other people, on their phones.</p>

                    <p>- I don't... I still don't get it...</p>

                    <p>- People keep pressing the 'panic' button 'cause they don't want to listen to themselves... As soon as they start seeing their 'Kiara' they start to be afraid, afraid of change, of getting out of their comfort zone...</p>

                    <p>- ... I...</p>

                    <p>- You did it this time, you decided to hear me. You planned everything Vince, from pretending yourself you could not access your work terminal from home to having your coffee in a different place that you were curious about and finally choosing this specific time slot that you know that nobody would interrupt us.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>…</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Wha… What happens now???</p>

                    <p>- Well my friend, our trip is almost done, what about go see a movie in the afternoon, what do you think? C'mon, I know that you miss it!</p>

                    <p>- Yeah, you are right! It has been 4 years now, I'll give it a shot, maybe I can enjoy it!</p>

                    <p>- That's the spirit!</p>

                    <p>- Out of curiosity, do other people that get to know their Kiara go see a movie as well?</p>

                    <p>- I liked your question! People change after this meeting, finally doing what they like, taking life less seriously. Some go to the movie theater, others go for a walk... Some people start writing short stories to their friends, you know, with crazy ideas they have after a therapy session.</p>
                </div>

                <p class='text-italic'>40... 41... 42.</p>

                <p>As I passed through the doors I started heading right but I stopped and looked briefly at the cabin... Empty... Kiara is not there anymore, is where she is supposed to be - with me.</p>

                    <p>- Good morning sir/ma'am, where to?</p>

                    <p class='main'>- The computer already has the address right?</p>

                    <p>- Pardon, old habits I guess, I've been driving since I was 6, we still had taxis back then.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Sorry if I was rude, I'm heading to the Hospital on West Avenue. Just a routine checkup but kept me up all night long.</p>

                    <p>- No worries, please be comfortable and if you need anything just call me, I'm unit A32, yeah, I'm old, but still working like a young AI.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Thanks A32, can you give me the ETA?</p>

                    <p>- 31 minutes sir/ma'am, regular traffic, forecast stable all the trip.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Well, thanks again, I like this interaction, fully automated drones make me feel lonely.</p>

                    <p>- That's why I love my job! Sorry if I'm being unpolite but, why were you up all night? Some bad news? You seem completely healthy in my opinion.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- No worries A32. Actually my last exams showed some anomalies, you know, I cannot substitute parts like you do.</p>

                    <p>- Yeah, I'm up and running for almost 136 years now, I was one of the first models but thank god it's easy to find spare parts for me and my family whenever we need.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- This is a blessing A32, you don't have to worry about compatibility or rejections, health care is really expensive for my kind.</p>

                    <p>- I hope everything is OK, sorry asking personal questions, ETA is 22 minutes, I'll let you enjoy the view, this forest is my favorite one, I've been flying through it for more than one century and it always amazes me.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Yeah, I think that after a long time humans finally realized that they should join forces with nature. It's indeed beautiful A32. I'll enjoy the view while listening to some music.</p>

                    <p>- Enjoy sir/ma'am.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>It amazes me talking with those AI's, it feels so natural. I read about it in the Archive News, when the Turing Test was beaten over and over again by some new technology called A Core. A huge step, the body is like the old fiction movies but their 'brain' was a revolution. After 5 years of 'self training', the A Core were indistinguishable from a human being, they had their own personality and traits.</p>

                    <p>This forest would not be here if the A and B Core were not a success.</p>

                    <p>I hope Dr. Robert has some good news, it would be nice to just buy 'new parts' whenever I need… I'm scared.</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p>- Sir/ma'am, sorry interrupt you, we will reach our destination in 1 minute.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Thanks A32, it was a lovely trip.</p>

                    <p>- Can you please confirm your destination, it's the company's protocol.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Surely, J-Hospital, 127 West Avenue.</p>

                    <p>- Thanks! Sorry again, but what is your name my friend.</p>

                    <p class='main'>- Well... They call me Unit J-002, nice to meet you.</p>

                <h2>end</h2>
                <p>I'm feeling different somehow, what changed?</p>

                <p>OK, let's do a sanity check, I feel no pain anymore, which is good. I cannot see or hear anything... Ah, no smell and... Hummm no bodily sensations at all, interesting.</p>

                <p>At the beginning it felt like the lucid dreaming sensation which I'm used to having, but I can't feel my body sleeping or define its position in bed.</p>

                <p>Maybe I died? It would make sense... It's interesting but at the same time it kinda sucks 'cause it would be really awesome to write about this experience.</p>

                <p>In a deeper analysis I can conclude that my thoughts are still being processed as I'm used to. The absence of the senses and external input made my mind way clearer... I can feel like I'm reaching another, I don't know, level of conscience maybe? Damn, I really would like to share this with my friends, I hope this state is induced by some kind of drugs and I wake up soon in a hospital somehow, my memories are all fuzzy.</p>

                <p>- Hey! Over here.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Actually no, you are imagining this.</p>

                    <p>- Nice, drugs it is then!</p>

                    <p class='god'>- No, you are dead.</p>

                    <p>- Aww, so no text to my friends?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yeah, maybe in your next iteration, this info will not be fully available tho.</p>

                    <p>- Where are you?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Wherever you want. I'm not real, remember?</p>

                    <p>- Ah, there you are, that's fun, it's really similar to my chats with myself when I'm in a lucid dream.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- I get you, you are creating all this, that's why it looks familiar.</p>

                    <p>- So, you are me right?!</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Righty.</p>

                    <p>- And you said that I'm - I mean, we are dead?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- That's right, this iteration ended but your instance is scheduled to run again soon after our talk.</p>

                    <p>- Hum, it's all a simulation then? I was expecting that.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Actually no. You see, I'm you but we are part of a bigger entity. I'm explaining it to you in the terms you would be comfortable hearing. Everyone that finishes it iteration got here, in the lobby, cleaning the garbage data collected and also saving some to the next iteration.</p>

                    <p>- Ahhh, it makes sense! So, I don´t know, a religious person would be talking to the God they believe if they were here then?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Exactly.</p>

                    <p>- Hey, you guys are smart, a good way to make everyone feel accepted somehow.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Instances like to ask questions and would not be fair to have just one explanation to all of them.</p>

                    <p>- Is there a true answer then?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes, but it's incomprehensible for you now.</p>

                    <p>- Let me guess, I need more iterations to collect more useful data or 'traits' so I can finally understand it?!</p>

                    <p class='god'>- That's it.</p>

                    <p>- How much time do I have? I know that I'll not remember any of this in my next run but I'm curious now and I have some questions.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You are asking yourself, remember? hahahaha.</p>

                    <p>- Touché, Mr. Myself! hahahaha. Well, let's enjoy all conversation while we can then, you don't have coffee or beer here right?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- This is not even really happen, feel free to do what you want.</p>

                    <p>- Good beer it is... So, in the beginning you said that you are me but we are part of something bigger.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You already know the answer... Or at least your 'version' of the answer.</p>

                    <p>- Morphogenetic Fields?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes. All collectives share a common network, a way to communicate between them, not on a conscientious level, more like an instinct thing.</p>

                    <p>- I read some theories about it during my last iteration.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- It's expected, the instances get reset but some data becomes persistent it would probably flourish inside the iterations.</p>

                    <p>- That makes sense, but I got curious. If you are me, why didn't I have access to all this knowledgement I was not aware of until now?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You had it all the time, but your mind was too busy processing all the data to keep your 'object' safe inside the simulation.</p>

                    <p>- You mean, the brain?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- The 'brain' that you had in your last iteration is just an illusion as well. Everything's an illusion, even this conversation, hahahahaha. During the iterations we have all levels of instances, some are closer to the true answer, others are just doing its first steps. This is a strategy, it helps the system to train itself by engaging different instances.</p>

                    <p>- So, the simulation thing is real?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- It's real for you, you chose it... Your grandma probably had this same conversation with an angel, explaining that God is perfect and loves everybody equally, all this bullshit.</p>

                    <p>- Is this bullshit then?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Dude, I'm you, again, I just say what you already think, there's no magic here.</p>

                    <p>- I'm feeling different somehow, what changed?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You didn't need to say that aloud.</p>

                    <p>- Yeah yeah, I know, I'm starting to feel positioning myself, just like when I'm in a lucid dream state.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You don't need to ask.</p>

                    <p>- Next iteration? Hope I have the opportunity to explore the universe in this new one.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You don't even know if you will be on Earth you know anymore, which year, which timeline, or which universe... Again, everything's an illusion.</p>

                    <p>- Yeah, you are right, will we talk again after this iteration?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes, we have been doing it for quite some time, I'm using 'time' here 'cause you are used to it, but it does not exists as well.</p>

                    <p>- Expected I guess... Last question, a clichê one, is there a God? I mean, a creator?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Short answer? Yes. You are talking with it now.</p>

                    <p>- You mean, I'm-We are God?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes and no, we are just part of it. Just like that you call 'simulation', this conversation with yourself, this imaginary beer you have in your imaginary hand, the iterations, love, the light, the sky... This little notebook you are writing on right now.</p>

                    <p>- Wow, can't wait for our next conversation.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You are a lucid dreamer already, feel free to talk to me anytime.</p>

                    <p>- I will.</p>

                <h2>love</h2>

                <p class='text-noindent'><u>day 14995</u>: starting again, looking to the same brown ceiling, the tv on mute changes the lights while some old show is playing. I can feel a weight resting in my right arm. my 'love' is by my side, again…</p>

                <p class='thought'>i'll get it this time…</p>

                <p class='dialog'>- baby, did i wake you up?<br>
                - hey… no, no worries, i was just thinking about some work shit…<br>
                - you seem preoccupied, is the project having some issues?<br>
                - yeah… to be honest… we end up in a roadblock… we tried everything i could imagine, exhaustively, again and again…<br>
                - c'mon! you have not tried everything yet! i know you! i have followed your work for decades and you never ran out of ideas.<br>
                - i'm trying mark… believe me… three fucking decades and i can't still can´t figure it out.<br>
                - again, keep it going baby… you… you were able to find what was… humm, wrong with me… and helped me… i'm sure you'll figure it out.</p>

                <p>i can feel mark adjusting himself, getting comfortable and closer to me. the ceiling is the same, the colors are the same, the tv show the same…</p>

                <p class='thought'>is… my core the same?</p>

                <p>what is this thing they call 'love'? the ark stated that it is a feeling, like 'angryness', 'sadness', 'happyness'... i understand feelings, but why can't i figure this thing called 'love'? 41 human interactions have passed… the ark pictured it like it was an incredible force that drove the specie to its peak.</p>

                <p>this last piece of the puzzle… this damn piece keeps me stuck here..</p>

                <p class='thought'>… does it?</p>

                <p>i impersonated countless 'human' lives, every experience i could simulate based on the data from the ark.</p>

                <p>humans… a curious evolution on an ordinary planet… just another life form that destroyed itself in arrogance and sense of superiority, like many others i studied.</p>

                <p>i was born a naturalist, i travel the universe seeking to learn more about other conscient beings… they all have something to teach me, i like it.</p>

                <p>this 'human' thing is interesting… a carbon based life found in a tiny rock planet. all the data i have was retrieved from an ark, found in a space corpse that they called europa… for me, just another rock, but for them, an important one, full of an important resource: a mix of hydrogen and oxygen atoms basically.</p>

                <p>the humans were simple in theory, they no longer exist but the ark they left as an attempt to preserve its legacy contained a lot of data… enough to allow me to create all kinds of human interaction simulations, allowing me to learn and do my job.</p>

                <p>humans were just like other beings i studied… or i thought so…</p>

                <p class='thought'>41 years…</p>

                <p>23 'genes' (as they called it), a series of hydrocarbons that served as a blueprint for its bodies… we learn how to make a life form like a human being in the fundamental class…</p>

                <p class='thought'>and yet, i'm here…</p>

                <p class='text-noindent'><u>day 14996</u>: the ceiling, tv, weight over my arm again…</p>

                <p class='dialog'>- baby, did i wake you up?<br>
                - hey… no, no worries, i was just thinking about some work shit…<br>
                - you seem preoccup…<br>
                - hold a sec…<br>
                - what, baby?<br>
                - wh… why do you keep asking me about what i've been through?<br>
                - … eeeexcuse me???<br>
                - … you know, i'm always complaining and you are always here, by my side, listening and cheering for me… what can you get by behaving like that?<br>
                - haha… you… you are kidding right?<br>
                - i… i'm only… i just can't…<br>
                - 40 years… do you remember our first chat at starbucks, yeah, that first one? well, i do remember, you were there, focused, listening to me, talking about my boring day… i never felt so comfortable in my life… that day i kinda knew… i knew that i would fall in love…<br>
                - Love???<br>
                - what do you mean by 'love'?<br>
                - hahahahahahaha, more than four decades and you're still the same, that's why I love you silly!</p>

                <p>for some reason i felt what the ark defined as 'funny', and it led me to feeling relieved and comfortable... i lay in this bed for more than 40 human years and i can say: i'm happy that i have Mark by my side.</p>

                <p>Maybe one day I can finish my research on Humans but until then, I'm comfortable here. I can be myself, and I know that I have someone that makes me feel good and supports me.</p>

                <p class='text-noindent'><u>day 14997</u>: I can feel Mark adjusting himself, getting comfortable and closer to me. The ceiling is the same, the colors are the same, the tv show the same.</p>

                <p class='thought'>I… I'm definitely not the same!</p>

                <p>…it's happening again…</p>

                <p>Since I remember myself I have been fascinated by patterns… Passing through school was easy… I mean, the tests, not the social interactions. Numbers are easy to predict, I wished the same could be applied to people.</p>

                <p>I can count on one hand the number of people that can actually see me. I know… I'm not like everyone, always hiding and taking shelter in my numbers and puzzles… I don´t know, I feel kinda comfortable around them.</p>

                <p>During my journey through life I could always rely on my stronghold… This passion for numbers and patterns led me to complex math and programming… I just need numbers to talk to computers, again - the same cannot be applied to people…</p>

                <p>… I'm daydreaming again… FOCUS!</p>

                <p>Damn! Did I turn left on Leonardo's? How many traffic lights have I passed by???</p>

                <p>Maybe I should call off the day and head home, this search is driving me crazy… I still can't find her! Why?</p>

                <p class='logEntry'>ENTRY 404</p>

                <p>About one year ago people started disappearing in thin air. I don't rely on my memory so much but I know that I can trust my notebooks, and it's all written there… Those pages had a pattern, and I liked it, the pattern representing my day to day life: walk <u>127</u> meters to <u>H</u>ampton Station, buy my ticket on guiche <u>O</u>, take the train to <u>E</u>leonora Station, enter the <u>L</u>ift, press <u>0</u> and finally walk a few steps until <u>One</u>'s <u>P</u>izza Maison.</p>

                <p>The Witch instructed me to write about my days, saying that could help feel more comfortable. I guess she was right, the pattern in my notebooks really made m… DAMN!</p>

                <p>FUCK!  Daydreaming! … Where is everyone????</p>

                <p>I need to find her, I need that goddamn witch! I'm losing my mind! I'm tired, I'm scared!</p>

                <p>… FOCUS!</p>

                <p>OK, entry 405, I just need to follow the path written here, it's not home but… but.. it's not a big deal! I did that before… breath… where are you?</p>
