                <h2>love</h2>

                <p class='text-noident'><u>day 14995</u>: starting again, looking to the same brown ceiling, the tv on mute changes the lights while some old show is playing. I can feel a weight resting in my right arm. my 'love' is by my side, again…</p>

                <p class='thought'>i'll get it this time…</p>

                <p class='dialog'>- baby, did i wake you up?<br>
                - hey… no, no worries, i was just thinking about some work shit…<br>
                - you seem preoccupied, is the project having some issues?<br>
                - yeah… to be honest… we end up in a roadblock… we tried everything i could imagine, exhaustively, again and again…<br>
                - c'mon! you have not tried everything yet! i know you! i have followed your work for decades and you never ran out of ideas.<br>
                - i'm trying mark… believe me… three fucking decades and i can't still can´t figure it out.<br>
                - again, keep it going baby… you… you were able to find what was… humm, wrong with me… and helped me… i'm sure you'll figure it out.</p>

                <p>i can feel mark adjusting himself, getting comfortable and closer to me. the ceiling is the same, the colors are the same, the tv show the same…</p>

                <p class='thought'>is… my core the same?</p>

                <p>what is this thing they call 'love'? the ark stated that it is a feeling, like 'angryness', 'sadness', 'happyness'... i understand feelings, but why can't i figure this thing called 'love'? 41 human interactions have passed… the ark pictured it like it was an incredible force that drove the specie to its peak.</p>

                <p>this last piece of the puzzle… this damn piece keeps me stuck here..</p>

                <p class='thought'>… does it?</p>

                <p>i impersonated countless 'human' lives, every experience i could simulate based on the data from the ark.</p>

                <p>humans… a curious evolution on an ordinary planet… just another life form that destroyed itself in arrogance and sense of superiority, like many others i studied.</p>

                <p>i was born a naturalist, i travel the universe seeking to learn more about other conscient beings… they all have something to teach me, i like it.</p>

                <p>this 'human' thing is interesting… a carbon based life found in a tiny rock planet. all the data i have was retrieved from an ark, found in a space corpse that they called europa… for me, just another rock, but for them, an important one, full of an important resource: a mix of hydrogen and oxygen atoms basically.</p>

                <p>the humans were simple in theory, they no longer exist but the ark they left as an attempt to preserve its legacy contained a lot of data… enough to allow me to create all kinds of human interaction simulations, allowing me to learn and do my job.</p>

                <p>humans were just like other beings i studied… or i thought so…</p>

                <p class='thought'>41 years…</p>

                <p>23 'genes' (as they called it), a series of hydrocarbons that served as a blueprint for its bodies… we learn how to make a life form like a human being in the fundamental class…</p>

                <p class='thought'>and yet, i'm here…</p>

                <p class='text-noident'><u>day 14996</u>: the ceiling, tv, weight over my arm again…</p>

                <p class='dialog'>- baby, did i wake you up?<br>
                - hey… no, no worries, i was just thinking about some work shit…<br>
                - you seem preoccup…<br>
                - hold a sec…<br>
                - what, baby?<br>
                - wh… why do you keep asking me about what i've been through?<br>
                - … eeeexcuse me???<br>
                - … you know, i'm always complaining and you are always here, by my side, listening and cheering for me… what can you get by behaving like that?<br>
                - haha… you… you are kidding right?<br>
                - i… i'm only… i just can't…<br>
                - 40 years… do you remember our first chat at starbucks, yeah, that first one? well, i do remember, you were there, focused, listening to me, talking about my boring day… i never felt so comfortable in my life… that day i kinda knew… i knew that i would fall in love…<br>
                - Love???<br>
                - what do you mean by 'love'?<br>
                - hahahahahahaha, more than four decades and you're still the same, that's why I love you silly!</p>

                <p>for some reason i felt what the ark defined as 'funny', and it led me to feeling relieved and comfortable... i lay in this bed for more than 40 human years and i can say: i'm happy that i have Mark by my side.</p>

                <p>Maybe one day I can finish my research on Humans but until then, I'm comfortable here. I can be myself, and I know that I have someone that makes me feel good and supports me.</p>

                <p class='text-noident'><u>day 14997</u>: I can feel Mark adjusting himself, getting comfortable and closer to me. The ceiling is the same, the colors are the same, the tv show the same.</p>

                <p class='thought'>I… I'm definitely not the same!</p>

                <h2>loop</h2>

                <p>…it's happening again…</p>

                <p>Since I remember myself I have been fascinated by patterns… Passing through school was easy… I mean, the tests, not the social interactions. Numbers are easy to predict, I wished the same could be applied to people.</p>

                <p>I can count on one hand the number of people that can actually see me. I know… I'm not like everyone, always hiding and taking shelter in my numbers and puzzles… I don´t know, I feel kinda comfortable around them.</p>

                <p>During my journey through life I could always rely on my stronghold… This passion for numbers and patterns led me to complex math and programming… I just need numbers to talk to computers, again - the same cannot be applied to people…</p>

                <p>… I'm daydreaming again… FOCUS!</p>

                <p>Damn! Did I turn left on Leonardo's? How many traffic lights have I passed by???</p>

                <p>Maybe I should call off the day and head home, this search is driving me crazy… I still can't find her! Why?</p>

                <p class='logEntry'>ENTRY 404</p>

                <p>About one year ago people started disappearing in thin air. I don't rely on my memory so much but I know that I can trust my notebooks, and it's all written there… Those pages had a pattern, and I liked it, the pattern representing my day to day life: walk <u>127</u> meters to <u>H</u>ampton Station, buy my ticket on guiche <u>O</u>, take the train to <u>E</u>leonora Station, enter the <u>L</u>ift, press <u>0</u> and finally walk a few steps until <u>One</u>'s <u>P</u>izza Maison.</p>

                <p>The Witch instructed me to write about my days, saying that could help feel more comfortable. I guess she was right, the pattern in my notebooks really made m… DAMN!</p>

                <p>FUCK!  Daydreaming! … Where is everyone????</p>

                <p>I need to find her, I need that goddamn witch! I'm losing my mind! I'm tired, I'm scared!</p>

                <p>… FOCUS!</p>

                <p>OK, entry 405, I just need to follow the path written here, it's not home but… but.. it's not a big deal! I did that before… breath… where are you?</p>
