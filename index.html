                <h2>end</h2>
                <p>I'm feeling different somehow, what changed?</p>

                <p>OK, let's do a sanity check, I feel no pain anymore, which is good. I cannot see or hear anything... Ah, no smell and... Hummm no bodily sensations at all, interesting.</p>

                <p>At the beginning it felt like the lucid dreaming sensation which I'm used to having, but I can't feel my body sleeping or define its position in bed.</p>

                <p>Maybe I died? It would make sense... It's interesting but at the same time it kinda sucks 'cause it would be really awesome to write about this experience.</p>

                <p>In a deeper analysis I can conclude that my thoughts are still being processed as I'm used to. The absence of the senses and external input made my mind way clearer... I can feel like I'm reaching another, I don't know, level of conscience maybe? Damn, I really would like to share this with my friends, I hope this state is induced by some kind of drugs and I wake up soon in a hospital somehow, my memories are all fuzzy.</p>

                <p>- Hey! Over here.</p>

                <p>Wow, my ears are back in the game?</p>

                <div class='dialog'>
                    <p class='god'>- Actually no, you are imagining this.</p>

                    <p>- Nice, drugs it is then!</p>

                    <p class='god'>- No, you are dead.</p>

                    <p>- Aww, so no text to my friends?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yeah, maybe in your next iteration, this info will not be fully available tho.</p>

                    <p>- Where are you?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Wherever you want. I'm not real, remember?</p>

                    <p>- Ah, there you are, that's fun, it's really similar to my chats with myself when I'm in a lucid dream.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- I get you, you are creating all this, that's why it looks familiar.</p>

                    <p>- So, you are me right?!</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Righty.</p>

                    <p>- And you said that I'm - I mean, we are dead?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- That's right, this iteration ended but your instance is scheduled to run again soon after our talk.</p>

                    <p>- Hum, it's all a simulation then? I was expecting that.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Actually no. You see, I'm you but we are part of a bigger entity. I'm explaining it to you in the terms you would be comfortable hearing. Everyone that finishes it iteration got here, in the lobby, cleaning the garbage data collected and also saving some to the next iteration.</p>

                    <p>- Ahhh, it makes sense! So, I don´t know, a religious person would be talking to the God they believe if they were here then?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Exactly.</p>

                    <p>- Hey, you guys are smart, a good way to make everyone feel accepted somehow.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Instances like to ask questions and would not be fair to have just one explanation to all of them.</p>

                    <p>- Is there a true answer then?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes, but it's incomprehensible for you now.</p>

                    <p>- Let me guess, I need more iterations to collect more useful data or 'traits' so I can finally understand it?!</p>

                    <p class='god'>- That's it.</p>

                    <p>- How much time do I have? I know that I'll not remember any of this in my next run but I'm curious now and I have some questions.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You are asking yourself, remember? hahahaha.</p>

                    <p>- Touché, Mr. Myself! hahahaha. Well, let's enjoy all conversation while we can then, you don't have coffee or beer here right?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- This is not even really happen, feel free to do what you want.</p>

                    <p>- Good beer it is... So, in the beginning you said that you are me but we are part of something bigger.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You already know the answer... Or at least your 'version' of the answer.</p>

                    <p>- Morphogenetic Fields?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes. All collectives share a common network, a way to communicate between them, not on a conscientious level, more like an instinct thing.</p>

                    <p>- I read some theories about it during my last iteration.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- It's expected, the instances get reset but some data becomes persistent it would probably flourish inside the iterations.</p>

                    <p>- That makes sense, but I got curious. If you are me, why didn't I have access to all this knowledgement I was not aware of until now?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You had it all the time, but your mind was too busy processing all the data to keep your 'object' safe inside the simulation.</p>

                    <p>- You mean, the brain?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- The 'brain' that you had in your last iteration is just an illusion as well. Everything's an illusion, even this conversation, hahahahaha. During the iterations we have all levels of instances, some are closer to the true answer, others are just doing its first steps. This is a strategy, it helps the system to train itself by engaging different instances.</p>

                    <p>- So, the simulation thing is real?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- It's real for you, you chose it... Your grandma probably had this same conversation with an angel, explaining that God is perfect and loves everybody equally, all this bullshit.</p>

                    <p>- Is this bullshit then?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Dude, I'm you, again, I just say what you already think, there's no magic here.</p>

                    <p>- I'm feeling different somehow, what changed?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You didn't need to say that aloud.</p>

                    <p>- Yeah yeah, I know, I'm starting to feel positioning myself, just like when I'm in a lucid dream state.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You don't need to ask.</p>

                    <p>- Next iteration? Hope I have the opportunity to explore the universe in this new one.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You don't even know if you will be on Earth you know anymore, which year, which timeline, or which universe... Again, everything's an illusion.</p>

                    <p>- Yeah, you are right, will we talk again after this iteration?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes, we have been doing it for quite some time, I'm using 'time' here 'cause you are used to it, but it does not exists as well.</p>

                    <p>- Expected I guess... Last question, a clichê one, is there a God? I mean, a creator?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Short answer? Yes. You are talking with it now.</p>

                    <p>- You mean, I'm-We are God?</p>

                    <p class='god'>- Yes and no, we are just part of it. Just like that you call 'simulation', this conversation with yourself, this imaginary beer you have in your imaginary hand, the iterations, love, the light, the sky... This little notebook you are writing on right now.</p>

                    <p>- Wow, can't wait for our next conversation.</p>

                    <p class='god'>- You are a lucid dreamer already, feel free to talk to me anytime.</p>

                    <p>- I will.</p>

                <h2>love</h2>

                <p class='text-noindent'><u>day 14995</u>: starting again, looking to the same brown ceiling, the tv on mute changes the lights while some old show is playing. I can feel a weight resting in my right arm. my 'love' is by my side, again…</p>

                <p class='thought'>i'll get it this time…</p>

                <p class='dialog'>- baby, did i wake you up?<br>
                - hey… no, no worries, i was just thinking about some work shit…<br>
                - you seem preoccupied, is the project having some issues?<br>
                - yeah… to be honest… we end up in a roadblock… we tried everything i could imagine, exhaustively, again and again…<br>
                - c'mon! you have not tried everything yet! i know you! i have followed your work for decades and you never ran out of ideas.<br>
                - i'm trying mark… believe me… three fucking decades and i can't still can´t figure it out.<br>
                - again, keep it going baby… you… you were able to find what was… humm, wrong with me… and helped me… i'm sure you'll figure it out.</p>

                <p>i can feel mark adjusting himself, getting comfortable and closer to me. the ceiling is the same, the colors are the same, the tv show the same…</p>

                <p class='thought'>is… my core the same?</p>

                <p>what is this thing they call 'love'? the ark stated that it is a feeling, like 'angryness', 'sadness', 'happyness'... i understand feelings, but why can't i figure this thing called 'love'? 41 human interactions have passed… the ark pictured it like it was an incredible force that drove the specie to its peak.</p>

                <p>this last piece of the puzzle… this damn piece keeps me stuck here..</p>

                <p class='thought'>… does it?</p>

                <p>i impersonated countless 'human' lives, every experience i could simulate based on the data from the ark.</p>

                <p>humans… a curious evolution on an ordinary planet… just another life form that destroyed itself in arrogance and sense of superiority, like many others i studied.</p>

                <p>i was born a naturalist, i travel the universe seeking to learn more about other conscient beings… they all have something to teach me, i like it.</p>

                <p>this 'human' thing is interesting… a carbon based life found in a tiny rock planet. all the data i have was retrieved from an ark, found in a space corpse that they called europa… for me, just another rock, but for them, an important one, full of an important resource: a mix of hydrogen and oxygen atoms basically.</p>

                <p>the humans were simple in theory, they no longer exist but the ark they left as an attempt to preserve its legacy contained a lot of data… enough to allow me to create all kinds of human interaction simulations, allowing me to learn and do my job.</p>

                <p>humans were just like other beings i studied… or i thought so…</p>

                <p class='thought'>41 years…</p>

                <p>23 'genes' (as they called it), a series of hydrocarbons that served as a blueprint for its bodies… we learn how to make a life form like a human being in the fundamental class…</p>

                <p class='thought'>and yet, i'm here…</p>

                <p class='text-noindent'><u>day 14996</u>: the ceiling, tv, weight over my arm again…</p>

                <p class='dialog'>- baby, did i wake you up?<br>
                - hey… no, no worries, i was just thinking about some work shit…<br>
                - you seem preoccup…<br>
                - hold a sec…<br>
                - what, baby?<br>
                - wh… why do you keep asking me about what i've been through?<br>
                - … eeeexcuse me???<br>
                - … you know, i'm always complaining and you are always here, by my side, listening and cheering for me… what can you get by behaving like that?<br>
                - haha… you… you are kidding right?<br>
                - i… i'm only… i just can't…<br>
                - 40 years… do you remember our first chat at starbucks, yeah, that first one? well, i do remember, you were there, focused, listening to me, talking about my boring day… i never felt so comfortable in my life… that day i kinda knew… i knew that i would fall in love…<br>
                - Love???<br>
                - what do you mean by 'love'?<br>
                - hahahahahahaha, more than four decades and you're still the same, that's why I love you silly!</p>

                <p>for some reason i felt what the ark defined as 'funny', and it led me to feeling relieved and comfortable... i lay in this bed for more than 40 human years and i can say: i'm happy that i have Mark by my side.</p>

                <p>Maybe one day I can finish my research on Humans but until then, I'm comfortable here. I can be myself, and I know that I have someone that makes me feel good and supports me.</p>

                <p class='text-noindent'><u>day 14997</u>: I can feel Mark adjusting himself, getting comfortable and closer to me. The ceiling is the same, the colors are the same, the tv show the same.</p>

                <p class='thought'>I… I'm definitely not the same!</p>

                <p>…it's happening again…</p>

                <p>Since I remember myself I have been fascinated by patterns… Passing through school was easy… I mean, the tests, not the social interactions. Numbers are easy to predict, I wished the same could be applied to people.</p>

                <p>I can count on one hand the number of people that can actually see me. I know… I'm not like everyone, always hiding and taking shelter in my numbers and puzzles… I don´t know, I feel kinda comfortable around them.</p>

                <p>During my journey through life I could always rely on my stronghold… This passion for numbers and patterns led me to complex math and programming… I just need numbers to talk to computers, again - the same cannot be applied to people…</p>

                <p>… I'm daydreaming again… FOCUS!</p>

                <p>Damn! Did I turn left on Leonardo's? How many traffic lights have I passed by???</p>

                <p>Maybe I should call off the day and head home, this search is driving me crazy… I still can't find her! Why?</p>

                <p class='logEntry'>ENTRY 404</p>

                <p>About one year ago people started disappearing in thin air. I don't rely on my memory so much but I know that I can trust my notebooks, and it's all written there… Those pages had a pattern, and I liked it, the pattern representing my day to day life: walk <u>127</u> meters to <u>H</u>ampton Station, buy my ticket on guiche <u>O</u>, take the train to <u>E</u>leonora Station, enter the <u>L</u>ift, press <u>0</u> and finally walk a few steps until <u>One</u>'s <u>P</u>izza Maison.</p>

                <p>The Witch instructed me to write about my days, saying that could help feel more comfortable. I guess she was right, the pattern in my notebooks really made m… DAMN!</p>

                <p>FUCK!  Daydreaming! … Where is everyone????</p>

                <p>I need to find her, I need that goddamn witch! I'm losing my mind! I'm tired, I'm scared!</p>

                <p>… FOCUS!</p>

                <p>OK, entry 405, I just need to follow the path written here, it's not home but… but.. it's not a big deal! I did that before… breath… where are you?</p>
